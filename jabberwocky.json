      "He took his vorpal sword in hand;\n\tLong time the manxome foe he sought—\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree\n\tAnd stood awhile in thought.",
      "And, as in uffish thought he stood,\n\tThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\n\tAnd burbled as it came!",
      "One, two! One, two! And through and through\n\tThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with its head\n\tHe went galumphing back.",
      "\"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\n\tCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"\n\tHe chortled in his joy.",
      "’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\ntDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\n\tAnd the mome raths outgrabe."
